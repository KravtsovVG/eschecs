The code in this directory serves as a template of what needs to be
implement when you create a new windowing backend for fpGUI. It is
a copy of the OSX Cocoa windowing backend, so the files will ultimately
have to be renamed to match your new windowing backend, and not
conflict with the other backends of fpGUI.
